<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>The aim of this study is to examine perceived quality of life in Chinese older 
adults living with cognitive impairment and explore its associations with caregivers’ characteristics. Questionnaires were administered 
in person to 271 caregiver-care recipient dyads from urban communities in mainland China in 2019. We used the 40-item Alzheimer’s Disease-related 
Quality of Life tool and asked caregiver respondents to indicate care recipients’ life conditions. The questionnaire asked caregivers about their 
sociodemographic characteristics, levels of informal social support, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms. Caregivers’ higher levels of 
caregiver burden (β = > −0.19, p < .01) and depressive symptoms (β = > −0.19, p < .01) amongst caregivers were significantly associated with 
lower quality of life among care recipients. Informal support from relatives and friends to caregivers did not significantly affect quality 
of life of care recipients. The results suggested that reducing caregivers’ burden and depressive symptoms are essential to promote quality 
of life of care recipients. Formal support from health professionals, service organizations, and communities are urgently called to promote 
the wellbeing of Chinese families affected by cognitive impairment.<br>Keywords: Perceived Quality of Life, Burden, Depression, Social Support, Cognitive Impairment</p>

</b>
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the attitudes of patients to cancer diagnosis
disclosure (CDD) and impact factors in China.
  <br>
Methods: A structured questionnaire survey was applied to assess the preferences regarding to CDD of
403 cancer patients and 403 the relatives. The univariate and multivariate analysis were adopted.
  <br>
Results: Compared with the relatives (67.99%), more patients prefer CDD (88.59%) and need
encouragement from both relatives and physicians (82.88%). Majority of patients deemed that CDD
could facilitate them to collaborate with their physicians (91.56%) and achieve a better efficacy
(73.70%). In univariate analysis, significant factors associated with patient attitude toward CDD were
as follows: cancer type (P=0.018), CDD notifier (P<0.001), notifier attitude (P=0.002), pattern of CDD
(P<0.001), patient opinion on cancer (P=0.001), relatives attitude to CDD (P=0.040). Furthermore,
multivariate analysis revealed that following factors held statistical significance: lung cancer
(OR=0.119, P=0.006), stage I (OR=0.188, P=0.029), notifier: self-discovery of the cancer (OR=0.167,
P=0.002), and patient opinion on cancer: calm (OR=3.387, P=0.018).
  <br>
Conclusions: Patients are prone to accept CDD in China while relatives are reluctant to inform patients
about their illness. The patient attitude to CDD may be affected by cancer type, stage, notifier and
patient opinion on cancer.<br>Keywords: Attitude, Cancer Diagnosis Disclosure, CDD, Cancer, Relatives, Investigation</p><br>
